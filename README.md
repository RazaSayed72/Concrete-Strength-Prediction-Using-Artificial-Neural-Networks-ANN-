# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict concrete's compressive strength based on its ingredients and age. The dataset includes cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, aggregates, and age. It involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model training for civil engineering applications.
